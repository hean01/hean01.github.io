      <description>This post will be updated with a log of my journey brewing the show mead using the starter kit bought from PGW mentioned in earlier blog post.
Day 0 - 2017-04-02 I followed the receipe from the begin to end and was about spot on every step. I measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.060 and put the carboy in a good place for fermentation.
Day 1 - 2017-04-03 Added the Fermaid-K nutrients as per receipe and stired a little and boom the foamy scum rasied out of the carboy and seemed to never stop.</description>

      <description>I bought a mead start kit from PGW which included everything to start to create mead, all the equipments and the sanitizer, yeast and nutrient. This start kit is for creating 4 litres (1 gallon) show mead which is mead in its purest form, honey, water and yeast. The kit also includes a brewing instruction which I will describe below. This post will also be updated with a brew log as a reference for future brewing.</description>
