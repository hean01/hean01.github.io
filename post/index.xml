 Put the frozen fruits into a bowl in a hot warm water bath

      <description>This is the brewlog for Blueberry and Raspberry mead recipe I put together. Here follows the fermentation graphs.
I followed the recipe as advertised and was finished around 21:30. The must looks very dark as you can see in the picture below. Raspberry seeds seems to gather up on the bottom but the rest of fruit is floating at the top of the carboy.
Here follows the fermentation graph over time for this mead.</description>

      <description>I read up on degassing process before bottling the mead and found the approach of using vacuum do draw out the gas from the mead. After some more digging into the subject I found that a manual vacuum pump, used for resealing opened wine bottles could be used for the purpose. This seemed to be a very simple approach to degassing. No need to dipping a tool that need to sanitzed to swirl the mead.</description>

      <description>I bought a mead start kit from PGW which included everything to start to create mead, all the equipments and the sanitizer, yeast and nutrient. This start kit is for creating 4 litres (1 gallon) show mead which is mead in its purest form, honey, water and yeast. The kit also includes a brewing instruction which I will describe below. This post will also be updated with a brew log as a reference for future brewing.</description>

      <title>Midi sync Volca beats with Analog four</title>

      <description>I just recently got my Volca Beats analog drum machine and wanted to sync it up with my Analog Four. To enable Volca Beats to sync with external device using midi you need to make sure that clock source is configured to auto.
While holding down func key and power on the volca device, you will enter configuration mode of the Volca Beats. Pressing play button will cancel any changes, record will save the changes and reboot your device.</description>
