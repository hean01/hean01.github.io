This post will be updated with a log of my journey brewing the a Bravo
apple juice hard cider using the reciepe mentioned in post [blog post](../bravo-apple-juice-cider/).

{{< graph "/json/c01_bpm.json" >}}

Above is a graph of measured burps per minute (bpm) over time of this
brew log, showing the activity of the fermentation process.

### Day 0 - 2017-05-22

I followed the receipe from the begin to end and was about spot on
every step. I measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.050 and
put the carboy in a good place for fermentation.

### Day 8 - 2017-05-30

The fermentation activity is rounding off and i think its time for for
measure the FG. The cider is starting to clear up and stuff is
settling at the bottom of the carboy.
