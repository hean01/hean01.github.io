This post will be updated with a log of my journey brewing the a Bravo
apple juice hard cider using the recipe mentioned in post [blog post](../bravo-apple-juice-cider/).

{{< graph "/json/c01_bpm.json" >}}

Above is a graph of measured burps per minute (bpm) over time of this
brew log, showing the activity of the fermentation process.

### Day 0 - 2017-05-22

I followed the recipe from the begin to end and was about spot on
every step. I measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.050 and
put the carboy in a good place for fermentation.

### Day 8 - 2017-05-30

The fermentation activity is rounding off and i think its time for for
measure the FG. The cider is starting to clear up and stuff is
settling at the bottom of the carboy.

### Day 9 - 2017-05-31

I measured the FG to very near 1.000 and started to bottle the
cider. Made a priming solution using 50g table sugar and 2dl water and
stirred into the carboy before bottling. Now, let these bottle stay in
room temperature for at least a week and keep watch on them for the
pressure build up. I used PET bottles and felt how squeezable they
were.

The measure FG when bottling were measured to 1.010.

I took a taste sample and its pretty good flat as it is.

### Day 13 - 2017-06-05

For the last few days I have squeezed the PET bottles to get a feel
for the development of carbonation. Today I tried one, put one in a
fridge for 40 minutes to chill it and poured. There are a small hint
of yeast smell and it was way to dry. I want my cider dry but this was
really tart and dry, I guess the 10g priming sugar has fermented in
full. I tried some back sweetening using Bravo apple juice and got
closer to what I prefer.

The cider was carbonated but not enough, about 70% of target. I will
let these bottles stand for additional a week before I cold crash them
and try one more.
