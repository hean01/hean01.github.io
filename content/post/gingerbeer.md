This recipe is for 10L of non alcoholic ginger beer using a ginger
bug.

## Recipe

- 10L water
- 1L table sugar
- 1dl grated ginger
- 6 lemons
- 3 limes

1. Grate the skin of 3 lemons and 3 limes

2. Press the juice out of the lemons and limes and set aside

3. Mix sugar, grated giner and grated skin into the water

4. Bring the tea to a boil and turn of the heat and let the tea steep
   for an hour

5. Bring down the temperature of the tea to room temperature, for
   example put it into a cold bath.

6. When tea is room tempered, add the lemon / lime juice

7. Strain of the bits and pieces from the tea

8. Add 1L gingerbug to the tea and mix it up


Bottle the ginger beer and give it 3-5 days to ferment on bottle
before you put them into the fridge. I use PET bottles so that I have
control over how much carbonation is built up jus by pressing the
bottle.
