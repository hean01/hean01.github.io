I read up on degassing process before bottling the mead and found the
approach of using vacuum do draw out the gas from the mead. After some
more digging into the subject I found that a manual vacuum pump, used
for resealing opened wine bottles could be used for the purpose. This
seemed to be a very simple approach to degassing. No need to dipping a
tool that need to sanitzed to swirl the mead. Just put the cap into
the damejean and pump.

Went to the supermarket here in Sweden and bough a product named *"Vacu
Vin - Wine saver"*, which includes a pump and a cap, with option to
buy 3 pack of additional caps. I hoped that this cap would fit my 1
gallon damejean, and it did, like a glove...

I started to pump and created the vaccum and noticed directly that the
still mead started to move and bubbles started to raise to surface
again. I will keep this cap on and pump once again when bubbles stops
raising in the mead.

Conclusion: I will definitly buy the 3 pack of caps.
