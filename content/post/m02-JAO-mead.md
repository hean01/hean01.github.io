This post will be updated with a log of brew of one gallon
[JAO Mead](../jao-mead). I have changed the recipe using D47 yeast as
described in the linked post.

{{< graph "/json/m02_bpm.json" >}}

Above is an graph of measured burps per minute (bpm) over time of this
brew log, showing the fermentation process.


### Day 0 - 2017-04-09

I followed the receipe from my earlier
[blog post](../jao-mead). Measured the mead for an OG (Original
Gravity) 1.093 and put the carboy aside on the kitchen bench for
starting fermantation.

### Day 1 - 2017-04-10

I check the fermentation process and saw now bubbles in the
morning. However when I came home from work I could see that the
fermentation as started. I measured 24 bpm @ 20:00 and 36 bpm @ 24:00.


### Day 2 - 2017-04-11

Measured 32 bpm before I went to work @ 06:00. When I got home I took a
smell of it and it denfinitly have some orange smell to it. I also
measured 39 bpm @ 18:00. It looks very active now and there is some
foam building up on top of the must and the raisins does looks like
reverting back to grapes.

### Day 3 - 2017-04-12

Smells and looks good, fermentation still running good at 37 bpm @
18:00. Let's take a look at it in a few days.


### Day 9 - 2017-04-18

I inspected the carboy and could see some settlement on the bottom, a
few raisins has sunken too. Took another reading of burps per minute
28.6 bpm @ 20:00. It smells good and I need to lookup when to rack
this mead eg. removing the oranges etc. I'm a bit worried about it
goes down the drain.


### Day 10 - 2017-04-19

This batch is continuing its fermentation in a steady speed compared
to batch m01 and m03. Made a few burps per minute reading this day, started
with 28 bpm @ 08:00, 15.8 bpm @ 18:20 and 19.34 bpm @ 20:25.


### Day 11 - 2017-04-20

Another check in, fermentation goes on in a steady pace. Took two
measurements and update the graph. Still smells really nice from the
airlock, much nicer than the show meads batches.


### Day 16 - 2017-04-25

More then two weeks has passed and the mead is still fermentaing but
is rolling off from the active period. I'm worried about fruits
floating to build up some mold, no off smells yet but I think I can
see some build up on the orange fruits floating at top of mead. To be
on the safe side I will do this tomorrow.


### Day 17 - 2017-04-26

I racked this mead today off the fruits and sediment. I also took a
taste of it and the most significant tastes are alcohol and the
clove. Almost no resamblance of orange and yeast. Feels like this is
set to go for aging. I did not take a gravity reading.

### Day 20 - 2017-04-29

I needed the airlock for another batch so I replaced it with a VacoVin
cap and started to pump up a vacuum, degassing this mead. I need to
pump up the vacuum with about 6 hours interval. I also ordered an
additional carboy and water lock so I have equipment for racking.

### Day 24 - 2017-05-03

The new airlock delivered today and I replaced the VacuVin
cap. However it has another design then the old one so I will stop
measuring burps per minute for this batch.


### Day 33 - 2017-05-12

I checked this batch and found a layer of sediment has built up, some
burps are noted. Lets rack this batch to new carboy 2017-05-27.
