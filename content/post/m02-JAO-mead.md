This post will be updated with a log of brew of one gallon
[JAO Mead](../jao-mead).

### Day 0 - 2017-04-09

I followed the receipe from my earlier [blog post](../jao-mead). I
measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.093 and put the
carboy on a kitchen bench for starting fermantation.

### Day 1 - 2017-04-10

I check the fermentation process and saw now bubbles in the
morning. However when I came home from work I could see that the
fermentation as started. I measured 24 bpm @ 20:00 and 36 bpm @ 24:00.


### Day 2 - 2017-04-11

Measured 32 bpm before I went to work @ 06:00. When I got home I took a
smell of it and it denfinitly have some orange smell to it. I also
measured 39 bpm @ 18:00. It looks very active now and there is some
foam building up on top of the must and the raisins does looks like
reverting back to grapes.
