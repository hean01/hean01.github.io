This post will be updated with a log of brew of one gallon
[JAO Mead](../jao-mead). I have changed the recipe using D47 yeast as
described in the linked post.

{{< graph "/json/m02_bpm.json" >}}

Above is an graph of measured burps per minute (bpm) over time of this
brew log, showing the fermentation process.


### Day 0 - 2017-04-09

I followed the receipe from my earlier [blog post](../jao-mead). I
measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.093 and put the
carboy on a kitchen bench for starting fermantation.

### Day 1 - 2017-04-10

I check the fermentation process and saw now bubbles in the
morning. However when I came home from work I could see that the
fermentation as started. I measured 24 bpm @ 20:00 and 36 bpm @ 24:00.


### Day 2 - 2017-04-11

Measured 32 bpm before I went to work @ 06:00. When I got home I took a
smell of it and it denfinitly have some orange smell to it. I also
measured 39 bpm @ 18:00. It looks very active now and there is some
foam building up on top of the must and the raisins does looks like
reverting back to grapes.

### Day 3 - 2017-04-12

Smells and looks good, fermentation still running good at 37 bpm @
18:00. Let's take a look at it in a few days.


### Day 9 - 2017-04-18

I inspected the carboy and could see some settlement on the bottom, a
few raisins has sunken too. Took another reading of burps per minute
28.6 bpm @ 20:00. It smells good and I need to lookup when to rack
this mead eg. removing the oranges etc. I'm a bit worried about it
goes down the drain.


### Day 10 - 2017-04-19

This batch is continuing its fermentation in a steady speed compared
to batch m01 and m03. Made a few burps per minute reading this day, started
with 28 bpm @ 08:00, 15.8 bpm @ 18:20 and 19.34 bpm @ 20:25.


### Day 11- 2017-04-20

Another check in, fermentation goes on in a steady pace. Took two
measurements and update the graph. Still smells really nice from the
airlock, much nicer than the show meads batches.
