This post will be updated with a log of my journey brewing the show
mead using the starter kit bought from PGW mentioned in earlier [blog
post](../pgw-mead-startkit/).

### Day 0 - 2017-04-02

I followed the receipe from the begin to end and was about spot on
every step. I measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.060 and
put the carboy in a good place for fermentation.


### Day 1 - 2017-04-03

Added the Fermaid-K nutrients as per receipe and stired a little and
boom the foamy scum rasied out of the carboy and seemed to never
stop. Waited for 5 minutes and it settled and I could stir carefully
once again.

I could see bubbles (carbon dioxid) which is a sign that the yeast is
happy and alcohol is producing. The mead smells a bit of alcohol and
yeast. However there is no bubbles in the airlock as expected. It seem
to leak in the rubber cap so I ordered a plug for the carboy as
replacement.


### Day 2 - 2017-04-04

Gently stirred the mead and put it to rest. Seems to be more active
now, however I could not recreate the foamy scum as of yeasterday by
stirring.


### Day 3 - 2017-04-05

Added the last nutrient without stiring as per instructions. I also
replaced the rubber cap with the plug and the airlock started to
bubble as expected. I used a BPM (Beats per minute) android
application to track bubbles per minute aka. bpm.

First reading was 2 hours before the nutrient addition and then there
was 35 bpm. After adding the nutrients it raised to 94 bpm which after
an hour went down to 44 bpm.


### Day 4 - 2017-04-06

Now the bubble rate is down to 33 bpm and the fermentation is very
active. I can hear the carbon dioxid bubbling through the mead, just
as when you upon up an can of coke.


### Day 5 - 2017-04-07

I took three readings of bubbles this day and it drastically decreased
from 27 bpm to 6 ppm. I wont take any reading on regular basis from
here. Just check the mead from now and then.


### Day 8 - 2017-04-10

There are several minutes between each bubble in the airlock. There
are no signs of bubbles in the mead. Seems to have reached a very slow
fermentation process. There yeast seems to have settled on the bottom
of the carboy and the mead seems a bit clearer then last days. I
decided to rack this into another carboy to remove the sediment and
measure the SG (Single Gravity) in one week eg. 2017-04-16.
