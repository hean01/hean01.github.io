### Day 0 - 2017-04-29

I followed the recipe as described and was finished with the process
at 22:20. The must smells and tastes very good, I think this will be a
very greate sweet mead for a hot summer day.


### Day 1 - 2017-04-30

I checked the mead at 07:16 and it smells nice. The fermentation has
started and I measured 14 burps per minute.
