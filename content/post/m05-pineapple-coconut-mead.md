This is the brewlog for [Pineapple and Coconut mead](../pineapple-coconut-mead) recipe I put
together.

Here follows the fermentation graph over time for this mead.

### Day 0 - 2017-04-29

I followed the recipe as described and was finished with the process
at 22:20. The must smells and tastes very good, I think this will be a
very greate sweet mead for a hot summer day.


### Day 1 - 2017-04-30

I checked the mead at 07:16 and it smells nice. The fermentation has
started and I measured 14 burps per minute. At 22:00, I fed the mead
with 1.5g Fermaid-K and stired carefully.

### Day 2 - 2017-05-01

At 21:30, I stired the mead carefully to release oxygen. I noticed
some oily almost like butter which definitly comes from the coconut on
the stick I used for stirring. This really worries me a bit, however
it is very thick like butter so I hope it wont disolve into the
mead. As fast as fermentation rolls off I will rack the mead of this
stuff.


### Day 3 - 2017-05-02

Its time for another stirring and feeding with Fermaid-K. I could
smell something strange which I belive is the coconut "butter". I took
a taste sample and found that the balance of honey flower, pineapple
and coconut is wonderful. No off tastes at all. The honey and coconute
serves as a base with the fruitness of pineapple on top.

### Day X - 2017-05-12

Took some reading of 3.17 bpm @ 01:00, it smells really good and it
looks like some clearing has started. There is lot of sediments and
fruits so lets rack this batch this weekend.
