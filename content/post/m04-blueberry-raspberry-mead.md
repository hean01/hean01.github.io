This is the brewlog for Blueberry and Raspberry mead recipe I put
together. Here follows the fermentation graphs.

I followed the recipe as advertised and was finished around 21:30. The
must looks very dark as you can see in the picture below. Raspberry
seeds seems to gather up on the bottom but the rest of fruit is
floating at the top of the carboy.

### Day 0 - 2017-04-23

Just after 2 hours I noticed bubbles in the air lock, I measure it to
about 1 bubble per 2.5 minutes.
