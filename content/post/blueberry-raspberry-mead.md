I wanted to create a medium sweet melomel with blueberry and
raspberry. I started out with PGW show mead receipe and changed it to
the following.

* 250g frozen blueberries
* 250g frozen raspberries
* 1.5kg honey
* 2.5g Lavlin D47

## Receipe

1. Santize all of your equipment

2. Put the frozen fruits into a bowl in a hot warm water bath

3. Heat up water 2 litre of water to 30° celcius and stir up the honey
   into a must, then pour the fruits and juice into the cattle and
   stir for a while. Mash up the fruits to release the juices.

4. Transfer the must to the carboy and fill up with water to a target
   of 4l leaving headroom for foam during fermentation.

5. Measure and log the OG for of the mixture using your hydrometer.

6. Shake the carboy heavily to aeritate the must

4. Boil 100ml water and let it cool to 25° degrees, add 3g Fermaid-K
   nutrients and wait 10 minutes.

5. Add 2.5g yeast of D47 yeast, half of the 5g yeast package, into the
   water with nutrients for rehydration. Wait 15 minutes and then stir.

6. Do another aeritation shake of the carboy and then pitch the
   rehydrated yeast into the carboy.

8. Fill and engage the airlock into the carboy and place it on a dark
   place with a temperature around 20° celcius.

After 24 hours from the time when the yeast was added to the mead, add
1.5g Fermaid-K nutrients, half of the content left in the package, to
the mead and carefully stir to release oxygen from the mead.

After 48 hours from the time when the yeast was added to the mead,
stir once again to release oxygen from the mead.

After 78 hours from the time when the yeast was added to the mead, add
1.5g Fermaid-K nutrients, the lasting content of the package to the
mead. You should not stir the mead.

After 7 days, rack the mead into another carboy using nylon bag as
filter to catch residues of the fruits. Then let it finish its
fermentation and rach once again for aging in a new carboy.
