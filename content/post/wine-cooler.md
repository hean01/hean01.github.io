I found that one could make a sugar wash (sugar wine) as a base for
wine cooler. This is raw sugar, water, nutrients and yeast.

I calculated that i needed 250g sugar per liter water to reach a ABV
14.7% which seems to be a good target for a wine cooler base. My idea
is to ferment all sugars and kill the yeast in the sugar wash, then
use a essences for soda streamer and the soda streamer to carbonate a
alcoholic beverage.

This recipe is for 5 liter ciders follows:

* 2.5g Lalvin D-47
* 3g Fermaid-K
* 1.25Kg raw sugar
* 5l water


## Recipe

1. Sanitize all of your equipment

2. Dissolve the sugar in a kettle with 2l boiling water.

3. Add the sugar wash to carboy and fill the remaining 3l using cold water.

4. Measure and log the OG for of the mixture using your hydrometer.

5. Shake the carboy heavily to aeritate the must

6. Boil 50-80ml water and let it cool to 25° degrees.

7. Add 3g of Fermaid-K to the water and wait 10 minutes

8. Add 2.5g EC-1118 yeast to the solution and wait 15 minutes

9. Add 1dl of the sugar wash and wait 30 minutes

10. Do another aeritation shake of the carboy and then pitch the
	re-hydrated yeast starter into the carboy.

11. Fill and engage the airlock into the carboy and place it on a dark
    place with a temperature around 20° Celsius.
