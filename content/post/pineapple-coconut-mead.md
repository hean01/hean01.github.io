Heres my recipe for a Pineapple and Coconut mead. I will base this on
PGW show mead recipe but increasing the amount of honey to 3 x 650g
for a sweet mead.


* 5dl coconut flakes
* 1 pineapple, about 1 litre of pineapple cubes
* 1.95 Kg wild flower honey
* 2.5g Lavlin D47 yeast
* 6g Fermaid-K nutrients


## Receipe

1. Santize all of your equipment

2. Chop up the pineapple into 1 cm cubes

3. Heat up water 2 litre of water to 30° celcius and stir up the honey
   into a must, then pitch the pinapple cubes and the coconut
   flakes. Let it settle for a few minutes.

4. Transfer the must to the carboy and fill up with water to a target
   of 4.5l leaving headroom for foam during fermentation.

5. Measure and log the OG for of the mixture using your hydrometer,
   targeting 1.120 Oechele.

6. Shake the carboy heavily to aeritate the must

4. Boil 100ml water and let it cool to 25° degrees, add 3g Fermaid-K
   nutrients and wait 10 minutes.

5. Add 2.5g yeast of D47 yeast, half of the 5g yeast package, into the
   water with nutrients for rehydration. Wait 15 minutes and then stir.

6. Do another aeritation shake of the carboy and then pitch the
   rehydrated yeast into the carboy.

8. Fill and engage the airlock into the carboy and place it on a dark
   place with a temperature around 20° celcius.

After 24 hours from the time when the yeast was added to the mead, add
1.5g Fermaid-K nutrients, half of the content left in the package, to
the mead and carefully stir to release oxygen from the mead.

After 48 hours from the time when the yeast was added to the mead,
stir once again to release oxygen from the mead.

After 78 hours from the time when the yeast was added to the mead, add
1.5g Fermaid-K nutrients, the lasting content of the package to the
mead. You should not stir the mead.
