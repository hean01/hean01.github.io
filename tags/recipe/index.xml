      <description>Gingerbug is a probiotic starter culture for making homemade soda, ginger beer etc. A gingerbug is very simple to create and it will take approximate 4-6 days to get one ready for use. Then it is added to a soda tea and bottled to build up a nice fizzy soda. This receipe is will give you about 1L of gingerbug and it is good for a 10 to 15L final product.</description>

      <description>Kombucha is a non alcoholic fermented beverage which is produced using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) and sweetened black tea. You can do batches of Kombucha or setup a continuous brewing, this blog will describe the process of continuous brewing.
First you need to get hold on a SCOBY, you can either buy one online or grow one by your self. To grow one your self you need to get hold on a unpasteurized Kombucha drink.</description>

      <description>I got interested to brew a hard cider to this midsummer. I found that someone had success to brew a cider on a specific store bought apple cider (Bravo äppel juice) available here in Sweden. So this is my go at that.
The docket on the juice package told me that there are 9.5g sugar per 100ml. This means 95g per liter and that would give me a cider with approximated ABV of 5.</description>

      <title>Wine cooler</title>

      <description>I found that one could make a sugar wash (sugar wine) as a base for wine cooler. This is raw sugar, water, nutrients and yeast.
I calculated that i needed 250g sugar per liter water to reach a ABV 14.7% which seems to be a good target for a wine cooler base. My idea is to ferment all sugars and kill the yeast in the sugar wash, then use a essences for soda streamer and the soda streamer to carbonate a alcoholic beverage.</description>
