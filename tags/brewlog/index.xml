      <description>This time I wanted to set a sweeter batch of mead. I followed the PGW mead receipt but bumped up the honey from 1.25Kg to 1.5Kg. I will updated this post with more information during the timeline of fermentation and aging.
Day 0 - 2017-04-17 I blended 1.5 kg honey with 2 litre of warm water. Poured over to carboy and added 2 litre cold water. Took a measure of 1.</description>

      <description>This post will be updated with a log of brew of one gallon JAO Mead. I have changed the recipe using D47 yeast as described in the linked post.
Day 0 - 2017-04-09 I followed the receipe from my earlier blog post. I measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.093 and put the carboy on a kitchen bench for starting fermantation.
Day 1 - 2017-04-10 I check the fermentation process and saw now bubbles in the morning.</description>

      <description>This post will be updated with a log of my journey brewing the show mead using the starter kit bought from PGW mentioned in earlier blog post.
Day 0 - 2017-04-02 I followed the receipe from the begin to end and was about spot on every step. I measured the mead for an OG (Original Gravity) 1.060 and put the carboy in a good place for fermentation.
Day 1 - 2017-04-03 Added the Fermaid-K nutrients as per receipe and stired a little and boom the foamy scum rasied out of the carboy and seemed to never stop.</description>
