      <description>I have bought a co2 regulator with trapetz adapter for connection to a 430g &amp;ldquo;soda stream&amp;rdquo; c02 bottle and a PET adapter to push co2 into PET bottles. This allows me to kill the yeast, clear the brew and do back sweetening before bottling.
This brew will be based on blog post but with following modification; Add more sugar for higer ABV to compensate for the back sweetening using Bravo juice.</description>

      <description>Kombucha is a non alcoholic fermented beverage which is produced using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) and sweetened black tea. You can do batches of Kombucha or setup a continuous brewing, this blog will describe the process of continuous brewing.
First you need to get hold on a SCOBY, you can either buy one online or grow one by your self. To grow one your self you need to get hold on a unpasteurized Kombucha drink.</description>

      <description>I got interested to brew a hard cider to this midsummer. I found that someone had success to brew a cider on a specific store bought apple cider (Bravo äppel juice) available here in Sweden. So this is my go at that.
The docket on the juice package told me that there are 9.5g sugar per 100ml. This means 95g per liter and that would give me a cider with approximated ABV of 5.</description>

      <description>I found that one could make a sugar wash (sugar wine) as a base for wine cooler. This is raw sugar, water, nutrients and yeast.
I calculated that i needed 250g sugar per liter water to reach a ABV 14.7% which seems to be a good target for a wine cooler base. My idea is to ferment all sugars and kill the yeast in the sugar wash, then use a essences for soda streamer and the soda streamer to carbonate a alcoholic beverage.</description>

      <description>In this post I will talk about how to calculate sugar volumes for targeting a specific sweetness and or alcohol of a mead. In a recipe the final gravity is your target and you will choose a yeast to control the ABV and on top of that the amount of honey. Here follows a table of ranges of final gravity for a mead for different sweetness.

      <description>I wanted to create a medium sweet melomel with blueberry and raspberry. I started out with PGW show mead receipe and changed it to the following.
 250g frozen blueberries 250g frozen raspberries 1.5kg honey 2.5g Lavlin D47  Receipe  Santize all of your equipment
 Put the frozen fruits into a bowl in a hot warm water bath
 Heat up water 2 litre of water to 30° celcius and stir up the honey into a must, then pour the fruits and juice into the cattle and stir for a while.</description>

      <description>This is the brewlog for Blueberry and Raspberry mead recipe I put together. Here follows the fermentation graphs.
I followed the recipe as advertised and was finished around 21:30. The must looks very dark as you can see in the picture below. Raspberry seeds seems to gather up on the bottom but the rest of fruit is floating at the top of the carboy.
Here follows the fermentation graph over time for this mead.</description>

      <description>I read up on degassing process before bottling the mead and found the approach of using vacuum do draw out the gas from the mead. After some more digging into the subject I found that a manual vacuum pump, used for resealing opened wine bottles could be used for the purpose. This seemed to be a very simple approach to degassing. No need to dipping a tool that need to sanitzed to swirl the mead.</description>

      <description>This time I wanted to set a sweeter batch of mead. I followed the PGW mead receipt but bumped up the honey from 1.25Kg to 1.5Kg. I will updated this post with more information during the timeline of fermentation and aging.

      <description>I bought a mead start kit from PGW which included everything to start to create mead, all the equipments and the sanitizer, yeast and nutrient. This start kit is for creating 4 litres (1 gallon) show mead which is mead in its purest form, honey, water and yeast. The kit also includes a brewing instruction which I will describe below. This post will also be updated with a brew log as a reference for future brewing.</description>

      <description>I just recently got my Volca Beats analog drum machine and wanted to sync it up with my Analog Four. To enable Volca Beats to sync with external device using midi you need to make sure that clock source is configured to auto.
While holding down func key and power on the volca device, you will enter configuration mode of the Volca Beats. Pressing play button will cancel any changes, record will save the changes and reboot your device.</description>
